You are working on my NutriPlanPal web app. I need you to fix multiple functional issues and improve the dashboard experience so it’s clear, user-friendly, and coherent.

Non-negotiables

Do not introduce new bugs.

Keep changes minimal but effective: fix logic first, then UI polish.

No “AI” wording in the UI (users shouldn’t see “AI recipes” etc).

Use GBP (£) not USD ($).

If you change any data structure, update all dependent code.

Add clear loading states, error handling, and empty states.

1) Questionnaire flow bug (auto-navigates to dashboard)
Problem

When I reach the final questionnaire page, the app auto-clicks / auto-navigates to the dashboard. I need the user to have a choice (e.g., review answers, submit button, confirmation screen).

Requirements

Remove any auto-redirect or auto-triggered navigation.

Final step must present a clear CTA, e.g. “Finish & Continue”.

Only navigate after explicit user action.

Add a brief confirmation screen/section if needed.

Acceptance criteria

Reaching final questionnaire page does not redirect.

Navigation only happens after clicking the CTA.

2) Loading indicator for “Generate Meal Plan” (middle button)
Problem

The main “Generate Meal Plan” button (middle) doesn’t show loading. It looks like nothing happens unless I notice another loading state elsewhere.

Requirements

Add a loading spinner + disabled state on the same button the user clicks.

Button text changes while loading (e.g. “Generating…”).

Prevent double-clicks while loading.

If the request fails, show a clear error toast/alert.

Acceptance criteria

Clicking that button instantly shows loading feedback on the same button.

User cannot spam the button while a request is in progress.

3) Recommended Recipes are irrelevant / nonsense
Problem

Recommended Recipes show rubbish (e.g. savoury smoothies, weird desserts) that do not match the user’s preferences/goals.

Requirements

Update recipe recommendation logic to respect:

Questionnaire preferences (diet type, dislikes, goals, time constraints)

Meal type context (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack)

Basic sanity filters (no savoury smoothie unless explicitly chosen; no “dessert meal” unless user wants desserts)

Add guardrails:

Filter out recipes that violate preferences/allergens/dislikes.

Ensure titles and ingredients make sense (basic validation).

Add a fallback:

If you can’t find valid recommendations, show “No good matches – adjust preferences” and suggest what to change.

Acceptance criteria

Recommended recipes are consistent with the questionnaire.

Obviously nonsense outputs are filtered out.

4) Meal plan ordering is wrong (not ascending by day / meal type)
Problem

Meal plan appears in random order.

Requirements

Sort meal plan in a consistent structure:

Day order: Mon → Sun (or Day 1 → Day 7)

Within each day: Breakfast → Lunch → Dinner → Snacks (or whatever meal types exist)

Ensure the underlying data is sorted OR the UI layer sorts before render.

Acceptance criteria

Meal plan always displays in correct day + meal order.

5) Shopping list is not a proper shopping list + needs categories + download
Problem

Shopping list currently shows “ingredients” rather than a usable shopping list. It should be grouped and downloadable.

Requirements

Convert plan ingredients into a consolidated shopping list:

Combine duplicates (e.g. “onion” appears once with quantity summed if possible)

Normalise naming (e.g. “red onion” vs “onion” rules – choose a consistent approach)

Categorise items into sections like:

Produce, Meat/Fish, Dairy, Pantry, Frozen, Spices/Herbs, Bakery, Other

Add “Download shopping list”:

Provide PDF download OR CSV download (ideally both)

Include categories in the download

Add checkboxes for usability (optional but ideal).

Acceptance criteria

Shopping list is consolidated, categorised, and downloadable.

6) Recipes section is hard to find
Problem

There is no clear sign/button for where recipes are. Currently it’s buried under Settings, which is confusing.

Requirements

Add clear navigation to Recipes from the Dashboard (top nav or dashboard cards).

Settings should be for account/app settings only, not core features.

Acceptance criteria

User can find Recipes immediately from dashboard/navigation without guessing.

7) Move core sections out of Settings into Dashboard navigation
Problem

Recipes, Nutrition report, and Shopping List are currently living inside Settings, which is wrong.

Requirements

Restructure navigation:

Dashboard should have clear links/tabs/cards for:

Meal Plan

Recipes

Shopping List

Nutrition Report

Settings should contain only settings-related items.

Acceptance criteria

Core features are accessible via dashboard/nav, not Settings.

8) Nutrition report + Shopping List errors inside Settings
Problem

Nutrition report shows an error and Shopping List has issues (likely due to routing/state/data dependency).

Requirements

Identify why errors occur (console + network logs).

Fix root cause: routing, missing state, API response shape, null handling, permissions, etc.

Add error boundaries/empty states so it never shows a blank crash.

Acceptance criteria

Nutrition report and Shopping List load reliably from their new dashboard navigation.

9) Recipe quality + layout improvements + currency (£) + cost clarity
Problems

Recipes are low quality.

Layout is plain/not user friendly.

App uses $ instead of £.

Cost is unclear: what is it based on?

Requirements

Currency + cost

Change all currency display to £.

If you are showing “cost”, define what it means:

Is it an estimate based on ingredient prices?

If you don’t have real pricing data, label it clearly as “Estimated cost” and explain basis.

If cost is not reliable, remove it until it’s accurate.

Recipe output quality

Improve recipe generation templates/constraints to produce realistic recipes:

Real ingredients, real steps, sensible titles

Cooking times/servings included

Add validation (minimum viable quality checks):

Must include ingredients + steps

Must match meal type

Must not violate dietary constraints

UI

Improve readability:

Better spacing, headings, cards, and consistent typography

Clear primary CTA buttons

Keep it clean and modern, not cluttered.

Acceptance criteria

Currency is £ everywhere.

Cost is either clearly explained and reasonable, or removed.

Recipes are noticeably more realistic and better presented.

UI feels clearer and easier to use.

10) Remove “Generate AI recipes” wording + generate recipes based on updated meal plan
Problem

It says “Generate AI recipes” and recipes are not clearly tied to the current meal plan.

Requirements

Rename button/labels to:

“Generate recipes” / “Refresh recipes”

Recipes should be generated from the current meal plan:

If meal plan changes, recipes update accordingly.

Provide “Regenerate recipes from this plan” action.

Acceptance criteria

No UI mentions “AI recipes”.

Recipe generation is linked to the meal plan state.

11) Make meal plan interactive: click day/meal to view recipes (and optional day view)
Requirement

Users should be able to click the meal plan (day + meal) to view:

the recipe details for that slot

optionally show an “ingredients for this day” view (shopping list is weekly, so day view is optional)

Acceptance criteria

Clicking a meal plan entry opens the related recipe (modal or dedicated page).

The relationship between plan entry ↔ recipe is consistent and reliable.

Deliverables

Fix all issues above.

Provide a brief summary of changes + files edited.

Add basic tests or at least structured manual test steps.

Ensure no console errors on core flows.

Debugging steps you must do

Reproduce each issue first.

Check console + network logs for errors.

Add instrumentation/logging temporarily if needed.

Fix root cause, not symptoms.

If any requirement conflicts with the current architecture, propose the cleanest approach and implement it.
