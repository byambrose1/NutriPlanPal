3. Implementation Notes for Replit AI

Keep current font, text size, and style; only update the text content.

Rotate these headlines and subtext in a slideshow. Each slide shows the headline + subtext for 3–6 seconds before transitioning.

All subtext must address the pain point in the headline, positioning NutriPlanPal as the immediate solution.

Replace any family-specific language with inclusive phrasing to appeal to all demographics.

Maintain mobile responsiveness and usability for all devices.

Text should be in British English with an optional toggle for American English.

Optional: add minor micro-benefit bullet points below subtext if desired (e.g., “Save 2+ hours each week” or “Never repeat boring meals again”).
